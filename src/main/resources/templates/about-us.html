                    <h2>James Mansour</h2>
                    <p>My name is James Mansour. I got thrown into IT directly out of high school and found myself in a
                        place where I had to sink or swim and feeling like I had no idea what I was doing. Eventually I
                        moved up to managing labs throughout Microsoft and providing premier level support within Azure.
                        Working with Development and Test teams exposed me to the daily workflow and the challenges they
                        face and I instantly knew I was hooked. Especially being one that loves working with others and
                        being challenged to continually identify unique solutions to interesting problems. Fast forward
                        to today and I canâ€™t imagine doing anything but continuing to find, learn, develop and share new
                        ways that technology can help make one's life simpler and enable us to connect more on a human
                        level.</p>
