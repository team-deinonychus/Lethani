                    <h2>Garhett Morgan</h2>
                    <p>I am a Full Stack Software Engineer and Team Mate Extraordinaire! I have thrived in a team based atmosphere for my entire life. Whether it be playing high school and college sports, leading teams in the US Army, or managing sales staff, I have always put  the mission first and strive to elevate my teammates to rise to any challenge.</p> 
                    <br>
                    <p>I chose to dive into the Software Industry after starting a company whose goal was to connect attorneys to legal professionals so that tasks could be accomplished on the task by task basis. Given how successful other startups in the gig economy have done with these business models, my concept was picked up by a local tech incubator, and I took the idea all the way to starting our MVP. However, in order to accomplish this, I had to raise $350,000. Thus, an opportunity to learn a new skill and grow as a person was born! I am open to opportunities that take me near or far, and believe that there is no opportunity that I don’t have the ability to thrive in!</p>

                    <h2>James Mansour</h2>
                    <p>My name is James Mansour. I got thrown into IT directly out of high school and found myself in a
                        place where I had to sink or swim and feeling like I had no idea what I was doing. Eventually I
                        moved up to managing labs throughout Microsoft and providing premier level support within Azure.
                        Working with Development and Test teams exposed me to the daily workflow and the challenges they
                        face and I instantly knew I was hooked. Especially being one that loves working with others and
                        being challenged to continually identify unique solutions to interesting problems. Fast forward
                        to today and I can’t imagine doing anything but continuing to find, learn, develop and share new
                        ways that technology can help make one's life simpler and enable us to connect more on a human
                        level.</p>
